On my first day of learning MERN stack development, I got a good understanding of what the stack is all about.
MERN stands for MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js.
I learned that MongoDB is a database, Express is used to build the backend, React helps with the frontend, and Node.js runs JavaScript on the server.
